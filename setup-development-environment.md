# What is a development environment?

In this course, I'll show you how to setup your development environment to learn C# and .NET Core.  

A development environment is comrised of all the tools you'll need to write code, collaborate with others, debug your apps, compile your code, then distribute your applications to others.

================================================================

Learning Objective: The learner will set up their local development environment so that they can learn how to write C# and build applications.

Pre-requisites:
- A computer running Windows 10
- Basic command prompt commands like: dir, cd, mkdir

================================================================

To get started, you need three tools:

1. Dotnet Core SDK 3.1 or greater
2. Git 2.22 of greater
3. Visual Studio Code 1.46 or greater

If you already have these installed, you can skip this course.  Just make sure you have the right versions.  Open up your command line and do the following:

> dotnet --version
> git --version
> code --version

The Dotnet Core SDK contains the C# compiler which converts your code instructions into a language the computer can understand, the dotnet Core runtime which hosts your applications, the dotnet library which contains functions you can use in your programs, and templates for creating new C# projects and files.

Git is a source code management tool that allows you to access my code that is hosted on Github.  In many videos, I'll provide a URL, and you'll use a special set of commands in Git to download my code and even see a before and after version of my code.  Sometimes this will just be for reference, but other times my code will be a starting point for exercises and challenges for you to complete.

Finally, Visual Studio Code is the software you'll use to write C# code.  It is like a text editor, but has additional tools that accelerate a developer's workflow.

If you are experienced in downloading and installing programs on Windows, feel free to skip this course as well.  Just make sure you search and download the tools I list here.  You won't miss any significant background information, so feel free to move on.

If you're ready to get started with this course, we'll get started in the next video.
