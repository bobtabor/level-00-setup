# Set up your Development Environment

This is the content repo for the video course **level-00-setup** on [https://bobtabor.com](https://bobtabor.com).  The **Code** tab contains all of the scripts that I used for this course, as well as a place to view the **Wiki** tab containing frequently asked questions, and you can ask questions specific to this course on the **Issues** tab.

This course is a "Level 0" course, meaning that it is here to help prepare you for Level 1 courses.

## How do I ask a question about this course?

First, take a look at the **Wiki** tab.  Here I will post answers to frequently asked questions.
