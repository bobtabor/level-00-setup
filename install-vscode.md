Visual Studio Code is the most popular code editor in the world.  Not only can you develop HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also C#, Python, and Go.  Visual Studio Code is free, fast, cross-platform, and is easily extensible.

Visual Studio Code is different from the full Visual Studio IDE.  It's unfortunate that Microsoft decided to use the brand name "Visual Studio" since the new Visual Studio Code really has nothing to do with the full Visual Studio IDE.  I'll explain the difference in another course, but for our purposes, it's important that you install the correct product.

So, let's get started by searching for "Visual Studio Code download" in a search engine.  As I record this, you can download it from code.visualstudio.com, but since URLs change often, just make sure you search for it and only download the installer if the page looks like it's a Microsoft owned domain.

For the most part, we'll choose the default options.  However, totally optional, I will choose to allow Visual Studio Code to integrate more tightly with Windows Explorer, and I'll add it to the PATH variable so I can launch it from any directory when I'm in cmd, the Windows Command Prompt.

------------------------------------------------

Once it's complete, let's launch it and I'll pin it to my task bar so I can find it easily.

And it looks like VS Code is working and ready to go!
